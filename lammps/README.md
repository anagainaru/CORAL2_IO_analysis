## Experiments ran

**ASPHERE** models aspherical particles with or without solvent.

**ELASTIC** computes elastic constants at zero temperature, using an Si example.
And it's variant, **ELASTIC_T** computes elastic constants at finite temperature.

**HEAT** implements heat exchange algorithms (e.g. used for establishing a thermal gradient).
